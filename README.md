> **Evidence-Selective Medicine: A Six-Level Model of Institutional Bias in Clinical Medicine**  
> by Dolores Catherino

Using menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) as a central case study, the article asks:

> **Are current menopausal hormone therapy restrictions truly evidence-based,  
> or have they been shaped by systematic, institutional distortion of the evidence?**

The **Evidence-Selective Medicine (ESM)** framework describes six levels at which bias operates:

1. **Methodological asymmetry** – Similar flaws are treated as fatal or trivial depending on whether results support the prevailing narrative.
2. **Reporting asymmetry** – Relative risks are amplified; absolute risks and contradictory details are minimized or buried.
3. **Category error** – Data from one regimen or population are generalized to an entire therapeutic class (“hormone therapy”, “statins”, “antidepressants”).
4. **Semantic obfuscation** – Vague or umbrella language blurs distinctions in route, formulation, dose, timing, and patient ecology.
5. **Institutional commitment architecture** – Regulatory, legal, and guideline structures lock early interpretations into place, making revision costly.
6. **Ethical-framework failure** – Informed consent and shared decision-making exist on paper but are not implemented where they would disrupt restrictive norms.

In the context of MHT, ESM helps explain how:

- One WHI-era regimen (oral CEE + MPA in older women) was generalized to “hormone therapy” as a whole.
- Small absolute risk differences were framed as decisive harm signals, while fracture and metabolic benefits were downplayed.
- The FDA’s black box warning and conservative guidelines shaped practice long after the broader evidence base became more nuanced.

With the FDA now **removing the black box warning from most estrogen-containing MHT products**, this framework offers a way to critically re-examine how “evidence-based” policy was constructed and how similar patterns may appear in other areas of medicine.
