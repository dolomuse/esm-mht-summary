  <h1>Are Current Menopausal Hormone Therapy Restrictions Evidence-Based?</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    A one-page summary of the <strong>Evidence-Selective Medicine (ESM) 6-level model</strong> applied to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT).
  </p>

  <p>
    For decades, women have been told that menopausal hormone therapy is too risky for long-term use. 
    This page asks a simple question: <strong>are current menopausal hormone therapy restrictions actually evidence-based, or are they the result of systematic, institutional bias?</strong>
    The answer is developed in detail in the open-access article 
    <em>“Evidence-Selective Medicine: A Six-Level Model of Institutional Bias in Clinical Medicine”</em> by Dolores Catherino.

  <h2>Key Points in One Paragraph</h2>
  <p>
    When the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) results were first reported, findings from a single, older, oral CEE+MPA regimen were 
    generalized to “hormone therapy” as a whole, and framed as proof that menopausal hormone therapy was too dangerous for most women. 
    The ESM model shows that <strong>six layers of institutional distortion</strong> – from unequal scrutiny of data, to selective reporting, 
    to vague class labels, to liability-driven guidelines, to incomplete informed consent – turned a nuanced set of trial results into 
    a blunt prohibition. As modern evidence now supports timing-, route-, and formulation-specific MHT with favorable absolute risks 
    for many women, ESM explains why <strong>restrictions have persisted long after the science moved on</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is Evidence-Selective Medicine (ESM)?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Evidence-selective medicine</strong> is defined as a systematic asymmetry in how standards of evidence are applied:
    unexpected or paradigm-challenging results are scrutinized and discounted, while equally limited results that confirm the prevailing
    narrative are rapidly adopted and amplified. The ESM article describes a <strong>six-level model</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul class="key-points">
    <li><strong>Level 1 – Methodological asymmetry:</strong> same flaws treated as fatal or trivial depending on whether results fit the story.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2 – Reporting asymmetry:</strong> borderline or nonsignificant findings framed as decisive, while contradictory details are buried.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 3 – Category error:</strong> one regimen or population generalized to an entire therapeutic class (“hormone therapy”).</li>
    <li><strong>Level 4 – Semantic obfuscation:</strong> language choices that blur critical distinctions in route, formulation, dose, or timing.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 5 – Institutional commitment architecture:</strong> legal and organizational incentives that reward keeping the old story.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 6 – Ethical-framework failure:</strong> informed consent standards exist on paper but are not implemented where they would disrupt restrictive guidance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Does ESM Apply to MHT Restrictions?</h2>
  <p>
    Applied to MHT, the ESM model shows how WHI-based fears were turned into 
    <strong>class-wide, age-agnostic restrictions on estrogen-containing therapy</strong>, while:
  </p>
  <ul class="key-points">
    <li>Favorable data on younger women and early initiation were downplayed or treated as “subgroup” findings.</li>
    <li>Differences between oral CEE+MPA and modern transdermal estradiol plus micronized progesterone were collapsed into “hormone therapy” as a single risk category.</li>
    <li>Guidelines adopted the most conservative interpretation and then became structurally locked to it through malpractice, regulatory, and reputational pressures.</li>
    <li>Patients were rarely given absolute risks, or informed that reasonable experts and jurisdictions interpret the same data differently.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In this sense, current menopausal hormone therapy restrictions are not purely “evidence-based”; they are the product of <strong>evidence-selective medicine</strong>.
